## About the Project
In this project, the fine-tuning technique is applied to Meta's open-source model, **Llama 3**, to obtain a Large Language Model (LLM) capable of answering questions and following instructions with specialized knowledge in the field of finance. The main objective is for this model to be used in the future by finance professionals and enthusiasts as a tool to solve problems in different real-world contexts.

The project covers all stages of fine-tuning: data acquisition, cleaning and preprocessing, model training, and subsequent evaluation and testing. Various tools were used for this, with the Hugging Face platform and PyTorch being the most prominent.

The dataset used was **sujet-ai/Sujet-Finance-Instruct-177k**, which contains 177,597 entries with data for training models on different tasks related to the field of finance.

This project is still under development as an iterative process will be applied to improve each stage until achieving a model with the necessary capabilities to serve as a tool for solving financial problems. The aim is to expand the dataset to include new and better data and to enhance the model's knowledge so that it can address other tasks such as sentiment analysis or classification. Finally, in the future, the model will be brought to production through a web and mobile platform, thus achieving its main training objective: to be a tool used by users to solve real-world problems.

This project is open to receiving suggestions to help improve it.
